## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **reviewGate enforcement** — Now only applies to code task types (code, bug, feature, automation, system) — research, content, and custom types no longer blocked
- **Defensive settings access** — Prevents crash on missing config sections across all 8 settings tabs (General, Enforcement, Time Tracking, Agents, Projects, Sprints, Templates, Types)

- **Time tracking telemetry** — Fixed corrupt 17K-hour entry, added 7-day (604,800,000 ms) cap on `durationMs` validation
- **Archived task reappearance** — Tasks no longer reappear on board after archival (orphaned files from title changes now cleaned up via `findTaskFile`)
- **EnforcementTab formatting** — reviewGate warning text properly formatted, "Quality Gates" duplicate header removed

### Added

- **PRD-Driven Autonomous Development guide** — Complete 961-line guide at `docs/features/prd-driven-development.md` covering setup, agent execution workflow, OAuth2 example, configuration tips, and troubleshooting

- **Documentation Freshness Tracking** — Track document staleness with freshness scores, alerts, and optional auto-review task creation. API at `/api/doc-freshness`. Configurable via Settings → Doc Freshness.

### Fixed

- Persist runtime auth/config state to the Docker volume by routing `.veritas-kanban` paths through `getRuntimeDir()` and migrating legacy files on startup (`security.json`, agent registry, lifecycle hooks, error analyses, agent permissions).
- Added Docker migration guidance for recovering auth state after rebuilding containers.
- Dark mode Lessons Learned display bug fixed (text was unreadable in dark mode)
- Plain text card previews for task descriptions (markdown rendering disabled on board cards for performance)
- JWT rotation test flakiness fixed (timing issue resolved)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-10

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-09

### ✨ Highlights

**Veritas Kanban 3.0 ships the workflow engine** — a deterministic multi-step agent orchestration system that transforms VK from an ad-hoc task board into a repeatable, observable, and reliable agent execution platform. Think GitHub Actions for AI agents.

**14,079 lines of code shipped across 6 major phases:**

- Phase 1: Core workflow engine (~7,091 lines)
- Phase 2: Run state management (~1,409 lines)
- Phase 3: Frontend + real-time updates (~3,069 lines)
- Phase 4: Advanced orchestration (~2,255 lines)
- Dashboard: Monitoring & health metrics (~2,050 lines)
- Policies & Sessions: Tool policies + session isolation (~1,200 lines)

### Added

#### Core Workflow Engine (Phase 1 — #107)

- **YAML workflow definitions** — Define multi-step agent pipelines as version-controlled YAML files
- **Workflow CRUD API** — 9 REST endpoints for workflow management:
  - `GET /api/workflows` — List all workflows
  - `GET /api/workflows/:id` — Get workflow definition
  - `POST /api/workflows` — Create workflow
  - `PUT /api/workflows/:id` — Update workflow (auto-increment version)
  - `DELETE /api/workflows/:id` — Delete workflow
  - `POST /api/workflows/:id/runs` — Start a run
  - `GET /api/workflow-runs` — List runs (filterable by workflow, task, status)
  - `GET /api/workflow-runs/:id` — Get run details
  - `POST /api/workflow-runs/:id/resume` — Resume blocked run
- **Sequential step execution** — Execute workflow steps in order with retry routing
- **Step types: agent** — Agent steps spawn OpenClaw sessions with prompts (Phase 1 placeholder)
- **Template rendering** — Basic `{{variable}}` and `{{nested.path}}` substitution in step inputs
- **Acceptance criteria validation** — Simple substring matching for step completion checks
- **Retry routing** — Three strategies: retry same step, retry different step (`retry_step`), escalate to human
- **Workflow snapshot** — YAML saved in run directory for version immutability
- **RBAC** — Role-based access control with ACL files (`.acl.json`)
- **Audit logging** — All workflow changes logged to `.audit.jsonl`
- **Zod validation** — Schema validation for workflow definitions
- **Storage structure** — File-based persistence in `.veritas-kanban/workflows/` and `.veritas-kanban/workflow-runs/`

#### Run State Management (Phase 2 — #113, #110, #111, #108)

- **Persistent run state** — Run state survives server restarts via checkpoint timestamps
- **Progress file tracking** (#108) — Shared `progress.md` per run for context passing between steps
- **Step output resolution** — Template variables like `{{steps.plan.output}}` resolve from previous step outputs
- **Retry delays** — Configurable `retry_delay_ms` to prevent rapid retry loops
- **Tool policies** (#110) — Role-based tool restrictions:
  - 5 default roles: `planner`, `developer`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `deployer`
  - Each role has allowed/denied tool lists
  - Custom role CRUD via `/api/tool-policies` endpoints
  - Tool filter passed to OpenClaw sessions (ready for Phase 3 integration)
- **Fresh session per step** (#111) — Each workflow step can spawn a fresh OpenClaw session:
  - Session modes: `fresh` (new session) or `reuse` (continue existing)
  - Context injection: `minimal`, `full`, or `custom` (specify which steps to include)
  - Cleanup modes: `delete` (terminate after step) or `keep` (leave running for debugging)
  - Configurable timeout per step
- **Session tracking** — Session keys stored in `run.context._sessions` per agent
- **Backward compatible** — Legacy `fresh_session: false` maps to `session: reuse`

#### Frontend + Real-Time Updates (Phase 3 — #107 frontend)

- **WorkflowsPage** — Browse and start workflow runs:
  - Grid view of all workflows with metadata (name, version, agents, steps)
  - "Start Run" button → calls `POST /api/workflows/:id/run`
  - Active run count badges per workflow
  - Search filter
  - Lazy-loaded in App.tsx
- **WorkflowRunView** — Live step-by-step workflow run visualization:

- **Navigation tab** — "Workflows" tab added to header with icon
- **WebSocket integration** — Real-time updates via `workflow:status` events
- **Polling fallback** — Aggressive polling (10-30s) when WebSocket disconnected, safety-net polling (120s) when connected
- **~75% reduction in API calls** when WebSocket connected

#### Advanced Orchestration (Phase 4 — #112, #113)

- **Loop steps** (#112) — Iterate over collections with progress tracking:
  - Configuration: `over`, `item_var`, `index_var`, `completion` policy, `fresh_session_per_iteration`
  - Completion policies: `all_done`, `any_done`, `first_success`
  - Loop state tracking: `totalIterations`, `currentIteration`, `completedIterations`, `failedIterations`
  - Output per iteration saved to `step-outputs/<step-id>-<iteration>.md`
  - Loop variables accessible in templates: `{{loop.index}}`, `{{loop.total}}`, `{{loop.completed}}`
  - Max 1000 iterations safety limit
  - `continue_on_error` flag to skip failed iterations
  - `verify_each` and `verify_step` for post-iteration validation (wired in types, executor pending)
- **Gate steps** — Conditional blocking with approval workflow:
  - Boolean expressions: `{{test.status == "passed" and verify.decision == "approved"}}`
  - Supports `==`, `and`, `or` operators with variable access
  - Blocking behavior: run status changes to `blocked` if condition fails
  - Approval API: `POST /api/workflow-runs/:runId/steps/:stepId/approve` and `/reject`
  - Escalation policies: `escalate_to: human` blocks, timeout support
- **Parallel steps** — Fan-out/fan-in execution:
  - Execute multiple sub-steps concurrently via `Promise.allSettled()`
  - Completion criteria: `all` (all must succeed), `any` (at least one), `N` (at least N sub-steps)
  - `fail_fast` flag aborts remaining sub-steps on first failure
  - Aggregated JSON output with per-sub-step status, outputs, errors
  - Max 50 concurrent sub-steps (soft limit)
- **Enhanced acceptance criteria** — Regex patterns and JSON path equality:
  - Regex: `/^STATUS:\s*done$/i`
  - JSON path: `output.decision == "approved"`
  - Backward compatible substring matching
- **Expression evaluator** — Safe variable access and boolean logic (no arbitrary code execution)

#### Workflow Dashboard (#114)

- **Summary cards** (6 metrics):
  - Total workflows defined
  - Active runs (currently executing)
  - Completed runs (period-filtered: 24h/7d/30d)
  - Failed runs (period-filtered)
  - Average run duration
  - Success rate (%)
- **Active runs table** — Live-updating list of currently executing runs:
  - Workflow ID, status badge, started time, duration, current step, progress (step X/Y)
  - Click to open WorkflowRunView
  - Real-time updates via WebSocket
  - Visual progress bars
- **Recent runs history** — Last 50 workflow runs:
  - Sortable by status (all/completed/failed/blocked/pending)
  - Run ID, status badge, start time, duration, steps completed
  - Click to open WorkflowRunView
- **Workflow health metrics** — Per-workflow stats:
  - Success rate
  - Average duration
  - Run counts (total, completed, failed)
  - Visual health indicators (green/yellow/red based on success rate)
- **Real-time updates** — WebSocket-driven with polling fallback (30s when disconnected, 120s when connected)
- **Backend endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/workflow-runs/active` — Currently running workflows
  - `GET /api/workflow-runs/stats?period=7d` — Aggregated statistics (total workflows, active, completed, failed, avg duration, success rate, per-workflow breakdown)
- **Navigation** — "Dashboard" button in WorkflowsPage header

### Changed

#### WebSocket Refactor (Phase 3)

- **All hooks now WebSocket-primary** — Polling is safety net only
- **Connected behavior** — 120s polling intervals (safety net)
- **Disconnected behavior** — Aggressive polling resumes (10-30s intervals)
- **Events** — `task:changed`, `agent:status`, `telemetry:event`, `workflow:status`
- **Broadcast service** — Centralized `broadcastWorkflowStatus()` function sends full run state (no extra HTTP fetches needed)
- **13 hooks/components refactored** — All polling intervals updated

### Security

- **ReDoS protection** — Regex patterns validated with size/complexity limits
- **Expression injection prevention** — Template evaluator only supports safe variable access and boolean operators
- **Parallel DoS limits** — Max 50 concurrent sub-steps in parallel execution
- **Gate approval validation** — Authentication and permission checks on approval endpoints
- **Path traversal protection** — `sanitizeFilename` on all file writes

### Performance

- **~75% reduction in API calls** — When WebSocket connected, polling drops to 120s safety-net intervals
- **Progress file size cap** — 10MB limit prevents unbounded growth
- **Lazy-loaded frontend** — WorkflowsPage, WorkflowDashboard only render when navigated to
- **Memoized filters** — `useMemo` for filtered workflows/runs
- **Skeleton loading states** — Shimmer placeholders during data fetch

## [2.1.4] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Status Counter Accuracy** (#104) — Sidebar task counts now use a dedicated `GET /api/tasks/counts` endpoint that returns total counts by status, independent of time-range filters applied to the board view
  - **New:** `server/src/routes/tasks.ts` — `/api/tasks/counts` endpoint returns `{ todo, in_progress, review, done, blocked, cancelled }`
  - **New:** `web/src/hooks/useTaskCounts.ts` — dedicated React hook for sidebar counts
  - **Updated:** `BoardSidebar.tsx` — uses `useTaskCounts()` instead of deriving from filtered task list
  - Cache invalidation wired to task mutations so counts stay in sync

- **Bulk Operation Timeouts** (#105) — Bulk archive, status update, and backlog demote operations now use single API calls instead of N individual requests
  - **New:** `POST /api/tasks/bulk-update` — update status for multiple tasks in one call
  - **New:** `POST /api/tasks/bulk-archive-by-ids` — archive multiple tasks by ID array
  - **New:** `POST /api/backlog/bulk-demote` — demote multiple tasks to backlog in one call
  - All bulk endpoints validate array size (max 100) to prevent abuse
  - Operations run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled()` (~26× faster for large batches)
  - **Updated:** `BulkActionsBar.tsx` — rewired to use bulk endpoints instead of sequential loops
  - **Updated:** `useTasks.ts`, `useBacklog.ts` — new mutation hooks for bulk operations

### Changed

- **Squad Chat Documentation** (#106) — Updated `SQUAD_CHAT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` to clarify that the `model` field is a structural JSON field in the API, not a text instruction

## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Docker Path Standardization** (#102) — Comprehensive refactor: created shared `paths.ts` utility and migrated all 7 services to use it
  - **New:** `server/src/utils/paths.ts` — single source of truth for all path resolution
  - **Refactored:** task-service, activity-service, chat-service, audit-service, metrics/helpers, backlog-repository (7 files total)
  - **Resolution priority:** `DATA_DIR` / `VERITAS_DATA_DIR` env var → project root auto-discovery → fallback
  - **Safety:** Filesystem root guard prevents silent `/` resolution (the original EACCES bug)
  - **Backwards compatible:** Existing `DATA_DIR` configurations continue to work unchanged
  - **Cross-model reviewed:** 10/10/10/10 (GPT-5.1 authored, Claude Sonnet 4.5 reviewed)

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Docker Path Resolution** (#102) — Fixed WORKDIR resolution so services correctly find `.veritas-kanban` in containerized deployments
  - **Root cause:** Services use `process.cwd()/..` to locate project root; with `WORKDIR /app` this resolved to `/` (filesystem root), causing `EACCES: permission denied` on container startup
  - **Fix:** Changed production WORKDIR to `/app/server`, ensured `/app/tasks` and `/app/server` are writable
  - **Impact:** Resolves permission denied errors when starting VK in Docker containers
  - Related: Issue #102 (Docker: Standardize .veritas-kanban path resolution across services)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Reverse Proxy Support** (#100) — Added `TRUST_PROXY` environment variable for deployments behind nginx, Caddy, Traefik, Synology DSM, and other reverse proxies. Fixes `express-rate-limit` ValidationError and WebSocket authentication loops caused by untrusted `X-Forwarded-For` headers.
  - Supports hop counts (`TRUST_PROXY=1`), named values (`loopback`, `linklocal`), and subnet strings
  - `TRUST_PROXY=true` is blocked by default (security hardening — logs warning, falls back to no trust)
  - Disabled by default — no behavior change for existing deployments
  - Documentation added for nginx, Caddy, and Docker Compose configurations

### Security

- Blocked `TRUST_PROXY=true` to prevent accidental trust-all-proxies misconfiguration on public-facing deployments

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-06

### ✨ Highlights

**Veritas Kanban 2.0 is the multi-agent release.** 18 features shipped across agent orchestration, dashboard analytics, lifecycle automation, and developer experience. This release transforms VK from a single-agent task board into a full multi-agent orchestration platform.

### Added

#### Multi-Agent System (#28, #29, #30, #31)

- **Agent Registry** (#52) — Service discovery with heartbeat tracking, capabilities, live status, REST API for register/deregister/heartbeat/stats
- **Multi-Agent Dashboard Sidebar** (#28) — Real-time agent status cards in board sidebar, expandable details, color-coded status indicators (green=working, purple=sub-agent, gray=idle, red=error)
- **Multi-Agent Task Assignment** (#29) — Assign multiple agents to a single task, color-coded agent chips in task detail and board cards, shared helper utilities
- **@Mention Notifications** (#30) — @agent-name parsing in comments, thread subscriptions, delivery tracking, notification bell
- **Agent Permission Levels** (#31) — Intern / Specialist / Lead tiers with configurable approval workflows and autonomy boundaries

#### Dashboard Analytics (#57, #58, #59, #60, #61)

- **Where Time Went** (#57) — Time breakdown by project via telemetry data with color-coded project bars
- **Activity Clock** (#58) — 24-hour donut chart showing agent work distribution, sourced from status-history transitions
- **Hourly Activity Chart** (#59) — Bar chart with per-hour event counts, sourced from status-history
- **Wall Time Toggle** (#60) — Total Agent Time + Avg Run Duration with explanatory tooltips
- **Session Metrics** (#61) — Session count, success rate, completed/failed/abandoned tracking

#### Lifecycle & Automation

- **Task Lifecycle Hooks** (#72) — 7 built-in hooks (subtask-gate, assignee-required, blocked-reason, done-checklist, auto-archive, time-tracking, notification), 8 lifecycle events, custom hooks API
- **Documentation Freshness** (#74) — Steward workflow with freshness headers (`fresh-days`, `owner`, `last-verified`), 3-phase automation plan
- **Error Learning Workflow** (#91) — Structured failure analysis, similarity search for recurring issues, stats API. Inspired by @nateherk's Klouse dashboard concept.

#### Developer Experience

- **Markdown Rendering** (#63) — MarkdownText component for rich text in task descriptions and comments
- **Cost Prediction** (#54) — Multi-factor cost estimation model (tokens, compute, overhead) for task budgeting
- **CLI Usage Reporting** (#50) — `vk usage` command for token and cost reporting from the terminal
- **Dashboard Widget Toggles** (#92) — Show/hide individual dashboard widgets with settings gear and localStorage persistence
- **Production Binding** (#55) — `VK_HOST` and `VK_PORT` environment variables for flexible deployment
- **Custom favicon** — Purple scales-of-justice SVG icon replacing the default Vite favicon

### Changed

- **Timezone-aware metrics** — Server reports its timezone dynamically in all API response `meta`; clients can request metrics in their local timezone via `?tz=<offset>` query parameter
- **Activity data source** — Activity Clock and Hourly Activity Chart now pull from `status-history` (reliable state transitions) instead of `activity.json`
- **Cost-per-task clickability** — Enhanced hover states, border effects, and arrow indicator
- **Archive optimistic updates** — Archive mutations now remove tasks from cache immediately via `onMutate`, with rollback on error
- **Agent naming convention** — Agent names use ALL CAPS for acronyms (VERITAS, TARS, CASE, K-2SO, R2-D2, MAX)

### Fixed

- **Daily Activity 100% bug** — Utilization was calculated using UTC dates but displayed in local timezone, causing incorrect percentages
- **Feb 3 telemetry outlier** — 66-minute run normalized to 19min (p95 level)
- **Feb 2 telemetry outliers** — 3 runs (15-19min range) normalized to 10min
- **Registry stats interface mismatch** — Frontend expected `totalAgents`/`onlineAgents` but server sent `total`/`online`; interface updated to match server

### Security

- **MCP SDK vulnerability patched** — Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from 1.25.3 to ^1.26.0 (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7, cross-client data leak)
- **Rate limiting documented** — README now warns that VK does not include built-in rate limiting; reverse proxy recommended for public deployments

### Maintenance

- **21 stale feature branches cleaned** — Down to `main` only
- **README roadmap updated** — Reflects v2.0 shipped features, v1.6.0 and earlier history preserved
- **Version bumped** across all packages (root, server, web, shared, mcp)

### Credits

- [@nateherk](https://github.com/nateherk) — Error learning workflow inspired by Klouse dashboard concept
- [@mvoutov](https://github.com/mvoutov) — Documentation freshness inspired by BoardKit Orchestrator

#### Fixes

##### GH-86: Bulk Archive Silent Failure (#86)

**Root Cause:** `BulkActionsBar.handleArchiveSelected()` used `Promise.all()` with no error handling. When any single archive failed, the entire batch would silently reject with zero user feedback.

**Fix:**

- Import `useToast` hook
- Replace `Promise.all()` with per-task error tracking loop
- Show success toast (e.g., "Archived 5 tasks")
- Show error toast on partial/full failure with counts
- Log individual failures to console for debugging
- Clear selection regardless of outcome
- **File:** `web/src/components/board/BulkActionsBar.tsx` (+38 lines)

##### GH-87: Sidebar Task Counts Out of Sync (#87)

**Root Cause:** The sidebar uses `useMetrics('24h')` which polls every 30 seconds with 10-second staleTime. Meanwhile, `useUpdateTask` mutations did NOT invalidate the metrics cache, causing up to 30 seconds of stale data after status changes.

**Fix:**

- Add metrics query invalidation to `useUpdateTask.onSuccess()`
- Only invalidate when task status changes (prevents over-invalidation)
- Preserves timer state handling (no aggressive blanket invalidation)
- **File:** `web/src/hooks/useTasks.ts` (+9 lines)

### Scripts

- **scripts/dev-clean.sh** — Added explicit `pnpm` path resolution for launchd sessions (fixes "command not found" in automated restarts)
- **scripts/dev-watchdog.sh** — Improved restart storm prevention with lock file + PID checking; fixed pnpm path resolution

### CLI

- **`vk setup`** — New guided onboarding wizard that validates environment and helps new users get started:
  - Checks Node version (requires ≥18)
  - Verifies server is running and reachable
  - Tests API authentication
  - Optionally creates a welcome task with next steps
  - Supports `--json` output for automation and `--skip-task` to skip sample task
  - Credit: BoardKit Orchestrator (Monika Voutov) for the wizard pattern inspiration

### Fixed

- **Archive/Delete/Restore** — Fixed "Archive failed" errors caused by filename mismatch when task titles changed after creation. Now uses `findTaskFile()` to locate actual file on disk by task ID prefix instead of computing filename from current title
- **Sidebar Task Counts** — Fixed metrics showing time-filtered counts (e.g., 33 todo) instead of current board state (e.g., 124 todo). `/api/metrics/all` now returns current task status counts regardless of period filter; period only applies to telemetry metrics (runs, tokens, duration)
- **Backlog Count API** — Fixed double-wrapped response (`{data: {success, data: {count}}}`) by letting `responseEnvelopeMiddleware` handle wrapping

### Security

- **SEC-001 Extended** — Added path traversal validation to `trace-service.ts` (attemptId, taskId, traceId) and `template-service.ts` (templateId) using `validatePathSegment()` + `ensureWithinBase()`

### Changed

- Version bumped from 1.4.1 → 1.5.0

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-02

### Security

- **SEC-001 Path Traversal Prevention** — added strict path segment validation + base directory enforcement in server utilities; applied to file-based services that join paths from user-controlled ids
- **SEC-007 Admin Authorization** — enforced admin (or admin+agent where appropriate) on mutating settings/config/activity/status-history/notifications endpoints

### Fixed

- **Agent Status Panel** now uses real-time WebSocket updates (`useRealtimeAgentStatus`) and correctly handles `activeAgents` payloads
- Improved proxy/IP trust behavior for rate limiting (`X-Forwarded-For` only trusted when `trust proxy` is configured)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-01

### ✨ Highlights

- **CLI Workflow Commands** — Two-command task lifecycle (`vk begin` / `vk done`) plus time tracking, comments, agent status, and project management from the terminal
- Inspired by Boris Cherny's (Claude Code creator) "automate everything you do twice" philosophy

### Added

#### CLI Workflow Commands (#44)

- **Composite workflows** — Complete task lifecycle in single commands:
  - `vk begin <id>` — Sets in-progress + starts timer + updates agent status to working
  - `vk done <id> "summary"` — Stops timer + sets done + adds comment + sets agent idle

  - `vk agent status` — Show current agent status
  - `vk agent working <id>` — Set to working (auto-fetches task title)
  - `vk agent idle` — Set to idle
  - `vk agent sub-agent <count>` — Set sub-agent mode with count
- **Project management CLI** — `vk project list` and `vk project create "name"` with `--color` and `--description` flags

- **File Locking** — FIFO queue prevents race conditions on concurrent file writes
- **Request Timeouts** — Middleware kills hung connections before they pile up
- **Data Integrity** — Hash-chain verification + automatic backup on startup with rotation
- **Audit Log** — Immutable hash-chain audit trail for sensitive operations
- **Health Endpoint** — Liveness, readiness, and deep checks (storage, disk, task file)
- **API Envelope** — Standardized `{ success, data, meta }` response format across all endpoints
- **Schema Validation** — Zod schemas on all mutating API routes
- **Metrics** — Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring
- **WebSocket Heartbeat** — Connection keep-alive with automatic reconnection and connection limits
- **Error Boundaries** — React error boundaries with graceful fallback UI
- **Dependency Audit** — Automated vulnerability scanning in CI

#### Storage & Architecture

- Abstract file storage behind repository interface (prep for future database backends)
- Structured logging with pino (replaced all `console.*` calls)

#### First-Run Experience

- Example tasks auto-populate the board on first run (4 sample tasks)
- Manual seed script: `pnpm seed`
- Task data `.gitignore`d — your data stays private

#### Dark/Light Mode

- Settings → General → Appearance toggle (moon/sun icon)
- Persists to localStorage; default is dark mode
- Inline script prevents flash of wrong theme on load

#### UI Theme

- Primary color: purple (`270° 50% 40%`) with white text
- Focus rings, switches, and accents updated to match

#### Documentation

- TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
- Comprehensive FEATURES.md reference
- Agentic AI Safety best practices guide
- Roadmap section linking to v1.1 milestone
- Competitive comparison table
- OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot) attribution updated

#### Per-Status Selection (#24)

- Select All checkbox per column header
- Toolbar buttons for bulk operations scoped to selected status
- Column checkboxes for quick multi-select

### Fixed

- **Chat delete not clearing UI** — React Query kept stale cached data after session file was deleted; now uses `removeQueries` to nuke cache
- **Chat send broken after delete** — Server now recreates task-scoped sessions instead of throwing 404
- **Cross-column drag-and-drop** — Tasks reliably move between columns with local state management during drag
- **Dashboard agent comparison** — Fixed broken data fetch (raw `fetch` → `apiFetch` for envelope unwrapping)
- **Dashboard drill-down** — Removed duplicate X button, fixed focus ring clipping, wired up `open-task` event
- **Localhost auth rate limit** (#25) — Exempted localhost from rate limiting
- **Numeric inputs** — Clean inputs without browser spinners (#19)
- **Timer start/stop** — Optimistic UI toggle + cache patch for instant feedback
- **Task cache fragmentation** — All routes now use TaskService singleton
- **Sprint/Agent label alignment** — Fixed form layout in task detail panel
- **Sticky header** — Fixed positioning + matched indicator dot sizes
- **Keyboard test infinite loop** — Resolved render loop in `useKeyboard` + memoized context
- **Agent idle timeout** — Increased from 5 to 15 minutes to reduce false resets
- **File lock ordering** — Added in-process FIFO queue for deterministic write ordering
- **Search filters** — Added task ID to board and archive search

### Changed

- Agent status popover: moved idle description to bottom, added activity history link
- WebSocket indicator: click popover with connection status explanation
- Dashboard layout: Daily Activity (75%) + Recent Status Changes (25%) side-by-side
- Rolling average line: cyan-teal to contrast purple theme
- Bar chart hover: subtle muted fill instead of white flash
- All repo links updated to BradGroux (primary repo)
- All contact emails standardized to contact@digitalmeld.io
- Test suite: 72 files, **1,270 tests** (up from 61 files / 1,143 tests)
